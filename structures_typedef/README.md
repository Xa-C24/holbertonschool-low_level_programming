	A C structure is a user data type that allows variables of different types to be grouped together under a single name. 
	It is used to represent more complex records or objects by grouping together logically related elements.

	The `typedef` keyword is used in C to give new type names or aliases to existing types.
	 When used with structures, it simplifies the syntax by avoiding repeating the `struct`
	keyword each time a variable of this type is declared.

	The use of structures and `typedef` in C allows complex data types to be created and manipulated in a simpler, more readable way.
	 Structures allow variables of different types to be grouped together under a single name,
  while `typedef` makes it easier to declare these types, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.
