Doubly linked lists

    Doubly linked lists are a linear data structure used to store a collection of elements. 
    Unlike simply linked lists, where each element contains a single pointer to the next element,
    doubly linked lists contain two pointers in each node.


 -Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.

 - Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.

 - Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.

 - Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.

 - Write a function that frees a dlistint_t list.

 - Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.

 - Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.

 - Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

 - Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.
