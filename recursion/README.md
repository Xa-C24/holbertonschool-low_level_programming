_recursion

	 Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. 
 It allows complex problems to be solved by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems of the same type. 
 Recursion is particularly useful for problems that can be naturally divided into similar sub-problems, 
 such as recursive data structures (linked lists, trees) and search and sort algorithms.

	
	Recursion is a powerful technique for solving problems by breaking them down into similar sub-problems. 
	Although it can have drawbacks in terms of memory and performance, techniques such as memoization can help mitigate these.
