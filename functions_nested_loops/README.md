In this project, I learned about nested loops, header files, 
and variable scope in C while practicing declaring and defining my own functions.

Functions and nested loops are fundamental concepts in programming. Here is a definition and detailed explanations for each.

Functions:

	A function is a self-contained block of code designed to perform a particular task.
 Functions enable code to be structured into modules, code to be reused and code to be made easier to read.

 	Nested loops: Nested loops (or cascade loops) are control structures where one loop is placed inside another loop. 
 This makes it possible to iterate over several dimensions or levels of data.
