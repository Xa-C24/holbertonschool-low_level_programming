_functions_nested_loops

	Functions and nested loops are two fundamental concepts in programming. 
When we combine these two concepts, we can create powerful and efficient code structures to solve complex problems. 
Functions A function is an autonomous block of code that performs a specific task.
 It is used to modularise code, making it more readable and reusable.
This project in the Low Level Programming series is about:

What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
What are header files and how to to use them with #include
