	_Pointers, arrays and strings in C 

	Pointers, arrays and strings are fundamental concepts in C.
	 They are closely related and are often used together to manipulate data efficiently. 
	 Here is a definition and explanation of each of these concepts. 
	 Pointers A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
	 Pointers are used to manipulate data in memory, pass arguments by reference to functions,
	 and work with dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees.
